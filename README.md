# grid_position

### A simple program that returns coordinates of points in a grid.

1. The starting position of the 12x8 grid is variable, as well the spacing between the points.
2. Points are named as A1, A2, A3,..., H12. 
3. The starting position (A1) can take -1000 to 1000 a values.
4. The spacing between x and y are equal.


## Usage
Run the program: python3 main.py

The user has to answer the following prompt questions:
``` 
Select starting x position for A1: (enter any value from [-1000, 1000])

Select starting y position for A1: (enter any value from [-1000, 1000])

Select spacing for x and y: (enter any integer)

Show map? (Y/N)

Which point do you want to locate in this grid? (enter any point name from A1, A2, A3,..., H12)
```
